This console application is a school project.

The console application downloads the text from the provided link and splits it into sentences.
Each sentence is saved as an object in a list.

After that is done, you can edit/add/delete sentences in the list.

P.S.: Web Client uses "windows-1250" encoding because the text is in Slovak and needs a special charset for special characters (for some reason, UTF-8 does not work).
